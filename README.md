üöÄ Overview: ML-Enhanced Yield Optimizer
----------------------------------------

The `MLYieldVault` is an advanced Stacks smart contract designed to operate as a **DeFi Yield Optimizer**. What sets it apart is the integration of **Machine Learning (ML)-inspired mechanisms** for dynamic strategy selection and capital allocation.

Instead of relying on static rules or governance votes for rebalancing, this vault uses quantitative metrics like **Predicted APY**, **Risk Score**, and an **ML Weight** that adjusts based on historical performance. This creates a self-optimizing system intended to maximize risk-adjusted returns for depositors.

The contract manages staked STX (or a similar token) and calculates a fungible share token for users, reflecting their proportional ownership of the vault's total value locked (TVL), including accrued yield.

‚ú® Key Features
--------------

-   **ML-Inspired Strategy Scoring:** Strategies are scored using a formula that combines:

    -   **Predicted APY**

    -   **Risk Score** (a penalty for risk)

    -   **ML Confidence Score** (a boost for high confidence)

    -   **ML Weight** (dynamically adjusted based on past performance).

-   **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:** The `update-strategy-weight` private function implements a simplified, learning-rate-adjusted mechanism (akin to gradient descent) to increase the weight of high-performing strategies and decrease the weight of underperforming ones.

-   **Share-Based Accounting:** Deposits and withdrawals utilize the standard yield aggregator model: users receive shares proportional to the current TVL, allowing the vault to track and distribute yield seamlessly.

-   **Portfolio Rebalancing:** The `optimize-portfolio-allocation` public function allows the contract owner to rebalance the vault's capital across the best-performing, risk-adjusted strategies.

-   **Historical Performance Tracking:** The `performance-metrics` map tracks **Actual APY**, **Prediction Error**, and **Sharpe Ratio** over epochs, providing data for the system's "learning."

-   **Precision Handling:** Utilizes a `PRECISION-FACTOR` of $\text{u}1000000$ (6 decimals) for accurate financial and ML-related calculations.

üîë Public Functions (API)
-------------------------

### `(add-strategy (name (string-ascii 50)) (predicted-apy uint) (risk-score uint) (initial-weight uint))`

-   **Description:** Allows the `CONTRACT-OWNER` to register a new yield strategy with initial ML parameters.

-   **Authorisation:** Only callable by the `CONTRACT-OWNER`.

-   **Pre-conditions:** `strategy-count` must be less than `MAX-STRATEGIES`. `risk-score` $\le \text{u}100$. `initial-weight` $ > \text{u}0$.

-   **Returns:** `(ok strategy-id)` on success, or an error.

### `(deposit (amount uint))`

-   **Description:** Transfers STX from the sender to the contract and mints vault shares proportional to the current TVL.

-   **Pre-conditions:** `amount` must be $\ge \text{MIN-DEPOSIT}$.

-   **Logic:**

    1.  Calculates new shares using `(calculate-shares amount)`.

    2.  Transfers STX into the contract.

    3.  Updates `user-deposits` and global `total-value-locked` and `total-shares`.

-   **Returns:** `(ok shares)` minted on success, or an error.

### `(withdraw (shares-to-burn uint))`

-   **Description:** Redeems vault shares for the underlying asset (STX), including any accrued yield.

-   **Pre-conditions:** `shares-to-burn` must be less than or equal to the user's total shares.

-   **Logic:**

    1.  Calculates the proportional `withdrawal-amount` based on current `tvl` and `total-shares-supply`.

    2.  Transfers STX out of the contract to the user.

    3.  Updates `user-deposits`, `total-value-locked`, and `total-shares`.

-   **Returns:** `(ok withdrawal-amount)` on success, or an error.

### `(ml-rebalance-strategies)`

-   **Description:** Increments the `current-epoch`. This is a placeholder function that, in a full deployment, would initiate the actual fund reallocation process across integrated strategies based on the newly calculated ML weights.

-   **Authorisation:** Only callable by the `CONTRACT-OWNER`.

-   **Returns:** `(ok true)`.

### `(record-strategy-performance (strategy-id uint) (actual-apy uint) (sharpe-ratio uint))`

-   **Description:** Used by the `CONTRACT-OWNER` (or an oracle/off-chain ML service) to provide real-world performance data for a strategy. This function is the core of the "learning" process.

-   **Authorisation:** Only callable by the `CONTRACT-OWNER`.

-   **Logic:**

    1.  Calculates the `prediction-error` between `actual-apy` and `apy-prediction`.

    2.  Records the metrics in `performance-metrics`.

    3.  Calls the private `(update-strategy-weight)` function to adjust the ML weight based on the `performance-delta` (positive for outperformance, negative for underperformance).

    4.  Updates the strategy's `confidence-score` and sets the `apy-prediction` to the most recent `actual-apy`.

-   **Returns:** `(ok true)` on success, or an error.

### `(optimize-portfolio-allocation)`

-   **Description:** Executes the dynamic risk-adjusted portfolio optimization algorithm. This function calculates the optimal proportional allocation for all active strategies and updates the `total-allocated` field for each.

-   **Authorisation:** Only callable by the `CONTRACT-OWNER`.

-   **Logic:**

    1.  Uses `(calculate-all-strategy-scores)` to get a risk-adjusted, ML-weighted score for every active strategy.

    2.  Allocates the total `tvl` proportionally to these scores.

    3.  Updates the `total-allocated` field in the `strategies` map.

-   **Returns:** `(ok true)` if allocation is performed, `(ok false)` if total score is zero, or an error.

‚öôÔ∏è Private Functions (Core Logic)
---------------------------------

| **Function** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- |
| `(calculate-shares)` | Determines the number of vault shares to mint for a new deposit, accounting for existing TVL and total shares. |
| `(update-strategy-weight)` | **ML Training:** Adjusts the `ml-weight` for a strategy up or down based on its performance relative to its prediction, using a hardcoded learning rate. |
| `(calculate-risk-adjusted-score)` | **ML Scoring:** Computes a core return score by taking the `apy` and penalizing it by the `risk` score, then boosting it by the `confidence` score. |
| `(normalize-weights)` | A placeholder for a potential softmax-inspired function, intended to normalize a list of weights to sum to a target value (currently uses TVL for normalization in `normalize-single-weight`). |
| `(calculate-all-strategy-scores)` | Iterates through strategies to gather their ML-weighted risk-adjusted scores for portfolio optimization. |
| `(calculate-strategy-score-by-index)` | Calculates the final score for a single strategy by multiplying the `base-score` (risk-adjusted) by the `ml-weight`. |
| `(apply-strategy-allocation)` | Uses the final calculated score to determine and update the new `total-allocated` amount for a strategy. |

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
-------------

This contract contains simplified, illustrative logic for **ML-inspired** strategy selection. It is a proof-of-concept for how machine learning data (e.g., predicted APY, confidence) can be used for on-chain decision-making. **The actual ML model training and data integrity are assumed to be handled by a secure, off-chain oracle or trusted external entity** that calls the `record-strategy-performance` function.

**Do not use this contract in a production environment without rigorous security audits, formal verification, and a robust oracle system for the ML inputs.**
